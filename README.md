# LLaMA-Based-Generative-AI-Text-Generation-Project
This project utilizes Meta's LLaMA 3.2-1B model for natural language text generation. The model is loaded using Hugging Face's Transformers library with 4-bit quantization for reduced memory consumption. The system takes a user prompt (e.g., "Job description of Generative AI") and generates coherent and contextually relevant text as output.
